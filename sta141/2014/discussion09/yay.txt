How to fry an egg in cast iron:
===============================
1. Add "enough" vegetable oil (about 1 tsp) to cast iron skillet.
   Heat at medium.
2. When oil ripples, add egg. DO NOT DISTURB THE EGG. Sprinkle with a
   pinch of salt and white pepper (optional, and vastly superior to
   black pepper).
3. Once the egg has cooked on one side (about 2-4 minutes by my watch,
   but you probably have a different watch, or maybe even a sundial),
   gently flip it over. After flipping, DO NOT DISTURB THE EGG.
   SERIOUSLY, LEAVE IT ALONE. IF YOU MESSED WITH IT LAST TIME, YOU KNOW
   WHAT HAPPENS. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE!
4. Once the other side of the egg is cooked (about 1 minute less than
   the time it took to cook the first side), remove to a plate. 
5. Eat (mandatory).

ever notice how cats sometimes forget to pull their tongue back into
their mouth? weird. maybe the effort is just too much?
